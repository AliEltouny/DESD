The backend is 100% complete — fully functional, tested with Postman, and includes comprehensive error handling.

On the frontend, the UI is fully implemented. However, I'm currently facing an issue with fetching data from the backend. I've spent over 5 hours troubleshooting, but nothing seems to work. The API endpoints function correctly in Postman, and the code on the frontend appears accurate — the endpoints match and are properly structured — yet the data still doesn't load on the website.

If anyone has encountered a similar issue or has suggestions on what might be going wrong, I’d really appreciate your help. Thank you in advance!
